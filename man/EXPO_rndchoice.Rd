\title{EXPO random choices}
\usage{
EXPO_rndchoice(par, problems, type = 0L)
}
\arguments{
\item{par}{numeric vector specifying the discounting factor
and the choice sensitivity (in that order).}

\item{problems}{a numeric matrix with four columns containing for each decision
the outcome and delay of the sooner smaller option, the outcome and delay
of the larger later option (in that order).}

\item{type}{integer specifying the model variant to be used. See details.}
}
\value{
A vector of choices.
}
\description{
Generate random choice from various exponential discounting models.
}
\details{
Function takes parameter values and the choice problem to generate
deterministic choices.

Functions implements different variants as a function of \code{type}:

00 implements \eqn{k^delay} variant with exponential choice rule

01 implements \eqn{k^delay} variant with homothetic choice rule

10 implements \eqn{e^{k*delay}} variant with exponential choice rule

11 implements \eqn{e^{k*delay}} variant with homothetic choice rule
}
